# File Transfer using Socket Programming (TCP and UDP)

The idea is to provide a basic understanding of socket programming in python and analyzing the throughput achieved by differnet types of implementations. I have implemented variants of file transfer in terms of concurrency and algorithms. These variants are listed as follows:

1. Based on type of connection:
    - TCP
    - UDP
2. Based on Algorithms:
    - Nagle's Algorithm
    - Delayed ACK
3. Based on Concurrency:
    - concurrent server using Fork
    - concurrent server using threads
4. Based on Consistency:
    - Persistent TCP connection
    - Non-persistent TCP connection

## TCP usage

1. Analyzing the algorithms
    - move into the folder [tcp_algorithms](https://github.com/SoniSiddharth/File_Transfer_Socket_Programming/tree/main/tcp_algorithms)
    - run server using `python3 server.py` and enter the port number
    - run client in another terminal using `python3 client.py`
    - enter the port number of the server
    - follow the instructions to enable or disable the algorithms
    - user can ask for only one file at a time

2. Concurrency - fork
    - move into the folder [tcp_fork](https://github.com/SoniSiddharth/File_Transfer_Socket_Programming/tree/main/tcp_fork)
    - run the server using `python3 fork_server.py`
    - run client in another terminal using `python3 fork_client.py`
    - ask the files in spave separated fashion like `sherlock.txt warpeace.txt`
    - the client side will connect with the server individually for each file (running the all the clients simultaneously)

3. Concurrency - threads
    - move into the folder [tcp_thread](https://github.com/SoniSiddharth/File_Transfer_Socket_Programming/tree/main/tcp_thread)
    - run the server using `python3 thread_server.py`
    - run client in another terminal using `python3 thread_client.py`
    - ask the files in spave separated fashion like `sherlock.txt warpeace.txt`
    - the client side will connect with the server individually for each file (running the all the clients simultaneously)

4. Non persistent TCP
    - move into the folder [tcp_non_persistent](https://github.com/SoniSiddharth/File_Transfer_Socket_Programming/tree/main/tcp_non_persistent)
    - run the server using `python3 nonp_server.py`
    - run client in another terminal using `python3 nonp_client.py`
    - ask the files in spave separated fashion like `sherlock.txt warpeace.txt`
    - one by one file transfer (each creating a new tcp connection)

## UDP usage

In UDP, persistent and non-persistent remains same because there is no particular handshake in UDP which initiates the connection.
